# What is Holdem Heroes?

In addition to being used in our first official on-chain game of Texas Holdem, the data held within the HEH smart contract is freely available for any developers to integrate into their own smart contracts or NFT based games.

We have a suite of on-chain tools and contracts that can be used by game developers, including:

* decks of cards available as integer representations, strings or SVGs
* Poker start hands, complete with ranks, shapes etc.
* an on-chain Poker Hand evaluator, which can be used to rank a hand of 5 cards

Follow our handy guides to get started on the basics as quickly as possible:
