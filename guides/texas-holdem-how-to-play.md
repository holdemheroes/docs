# Texas Holdem: How to Play

Texas Holdem is the first game to fully utilise the Holdem Heroes NFTs and contract data. Here's a quick "how to play" guide.

### Start a New Game

Anyone can start a new game -  just set the desired round times along with the Flop and Turn bet sizes, then click "Start New Game".

### Flop

As soon as a new game begins, the Flop will be dealt. Due to the entire process being on-chain, and depending on network traffic, it may take up to a couple of minutes for the Flop to be dealt.&#x20;

Once the cards are revealed, the round timer will begin and you can start adding your NFT hands.&#x20;

Any Hole Card NFT that includes an identical card in the River will be disqualified from that game.

A separate transaction must be sent for each hand you would like to add to the next round.

Any hands you add during the Flop will be eligible to be added during the Turn, and only hands added to the Flop will be valid for using during the Turn round.

### Turn

Once the Flop round is over, the Turn card will be dealt. As soon as it is revealed, the Turn round timer will begin. During this time, you may add any of the NFTs you added during the Flop.&#x20;

Any Hole Card NFT that includes an identical card in the River will be disqualified from that game.

A separate transaction must be sent for each hand you would like to add to the next round.

Any hands added during the Turn round will be eligible for your final hand during the River round, and only hands added during the Turn will be valid for use during the River round

### River

Once the Turn round ends, the River will be dealt. As soon as it is revealed, the River timer will begin allowing you to submit your final hand.

For your final hand, you must select 3 cards from the 5-card River, along with one of your eligible Hand NFTs. These 5 cards will make up your final hand which can then be submitted in a transaction.

Any Hole Card NFT that includes an identical card in the River will be disqualified from that game.

### Winning Hand

After the round time elapses, anyone can call the End Game function. This calculates the winners and makes the winnings Claimable.

**Note:** Winners can Claim immediately after a game, or let their winnings accumulate to be Claimed at any later time.

The order of winning hands follows the standard rules of Texas Hold’em:\
_Royal Flush > Straight Flush > Four of a Kind > Full House > Flush > Straight > Three of a kind > Two Pair > Pair > High Card_

Every game results in multiple winners, with all Ether that has been bet distributed as follows:\
• 97.5 % to the Pot\
• 2.5% to the House

### Pot Distribution

Every game of Holdem Heroes results in up to 11 hands on the Leaderboard that win a portion of the Pot.

**The Leaderboard is comprised of:**\
• "Winners" - highest hand(s)\
• "Runners Up" - second highest hand(s)

**There is a maximum of 11 places on the Leaderboard.**\
**There is a maximum of 2 Winners.**\
**If more than 2 equal Winners submit their hands, the first 2 will qualify as Winners--others will be bumped down the Leaderboard.**

If more equal Runners Up than fit on the Leaderboard submit their hands, those first to submit will qualify as Runners Up.

**The Pot is distributed as follows:**

_If there is 1 Winner:_\
• 60 % of the Pot goes to the Winner\
• 40 % of the Pot is split evenly between up to 10 Runners Up

_If there are 2 equal Winners:_\
• 70% of the Pot goes to the Winners (35% each)\
• 30% of the Pot is split among up to 9 Runners Up

**Edge cases:**

**A) 2 winners but only 3 players**\
80% of the Pot goes to the 2 Winners (40% each)\
20% of the Pot goes the single Runner Up

**B) Only 2 players, both with equal hands**\
100% of the Pot goes to the Winners (50% each)
